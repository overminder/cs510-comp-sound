# Synopsis

Final project for CS 510 Sound (Spring 2019):

Build a MIDI synthesizer from scratch!

# Running

Make sure portaudio and Rust are installed, then
run `cargo run --release -- $MIDI_FILE` under project root (i.e.
The folder where this file resides) to play a MIDI file.
There are some sample MIDI files in `midi/`.

If you don't want to run the program, we also have synthesized samples
[deb_clai.aac] and [mz_545_1.aac] that can be played.

# Write Up

We have an extensive [write-up](write-up.pdf) that describes our project
in detail.
