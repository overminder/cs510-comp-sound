Phase 0: sine wave + damper
Phase 1: piano (sound normalization). The same damper seems to work well

Possible TODOs:
- other instruments: guitar organ etc
- optimization: pull based synthesis for real time playback
- GUI?
- Implement other control messages. (are they any?)
- Implement format 1 (multiple tracks)
- Stereo syntheize (or paremetrize over that?)
- Make use of pp and ff sounds (mix with mf?)
- Further normalize sounds?
- What about flat/sharp major/minor info? Are all note keys absolute?
- Fix crack sound (a bit obvious in chopin op66, also in debussy clai)
